// The files generated from lib dir, are NOT used at runtime. This is a legacy because originally the SDK was coded in JavaScript only,
// and .ts and /js files were maintained separate, causing double maintanance.
// We are now transitioning to TypeScript, new functionality that is added will be codes only in TypeScript. The generated .js files will be
// used at runtime
